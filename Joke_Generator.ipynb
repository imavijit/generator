One day he went to church and asked God to save him from a snake and he said, \"I could never kill a snake.\" He left because he did not want to see another person like him. So when my parents and I finally got around to visiting the dentist one day, Jesus said to us, \"Do not walk alone. A snake has come to your table.\" So Jesus went to me, \"Father, kill a snake.\" This guy was my doctor. I thought it was a good joke until I saw a picture of him in front of my doctor. He looked like a clown, his eyes were full of fear. That day I was very sad. My friend did his dissertation on the importance of spirituality. He asked about why we were all so different. He asked about how people got to love one another. \"Why do animals go to the doctor?\" He said, why don't you just become friends? Why are angels always friends with the other angels? Well, why not? You'd be amazed at how good the angels will be.\"\n",

The dentist said, \"I just wanted to know if you'd have a better doctor, doctor or dentist, right? Do you know any?\" The man went to the dentist, and said, \"No, I don't know any of these people. But maybe I do.\" So he came in and was shocked. So he came in and said, \"My god, what do you know about this guy, the doctor and this girl?\" And he said, \"My god, they don't even touch them.\" He went back to his parents and said, \"My god, do you know any of these people? The doctor and the dentist.\" So he went to tell them the doctor said to have my grandfather at table with him and the dentist. So he walked into the doctor's room.\n",

            "We do not know if the dentist was joking or not. He was very calm. He had always thought the dentist would be very polite, but he could not help but be a little bit sad. The doctor said, \"We'll see, my boy.\" So he went up and told this old teacher from a neighboring state. The old teacher started asking questions like, \"What do you do with the children?\" And he says, \"If they are young, you can go to the doctor and make a joke, or you can go back to the dentist.\" And he said to the old teacher, \"Now if I tell you how I had my first marriage today I will tell you that I met my first wife a couple of years ago and said things like, No one's the most beautiful girl in the world. But you're the best man for the job and we have to know where your heart comes from, so I'll put your heart at his beck and call.\" So the doctor looked at him and said, \"I'm going to ask you a few questions. Have you ever been to a doctor? A doctor. My god, where do these kids come from?\" He said, \"They come from the desert. From the deserts. They're not as good as the animals. They're good at math and science. So why do they like math with animals? Well, they're the best at math and science. They're also the smartest. And when a scientist goes to an animal, he's thinking about all the different kinds of animals, so I have to think a little bit.\" So he went up to the teacher and said, \"What do they need from me?\" And this teacher said to him, \"You're right. You know, my grandfather's been here for thousands of years. And because of his age he has a lot of problems, but he can find a way to fix those problems. What's the most important thing to you today? He has to do something he's not skilled at.\" So the teacher said, \"You see? What do you tell them? They have to figure that out themselves.\" So there was a lot of laughter at the end. This teacher came in and said, \"I knew you had problems. But I know you have your problems. How do you tell the boy?\" And then the boy said, \"There's no one here and you have to take care of yourself.\" So all of the kids went into the room. So that's how you get in.\n",

I said oh no I told you I think it's because the doctor liked my jokes. She goes, oh no I tell you now I know why you are here. \"What did you do today?\" Susan asked. Susan says, why did you do that? She then went on to ask the question, \"Was there a problem?\" \"No\" She said, oh no I did not need your help. She goes on to ask me how do I get your help, \"Have I answered myself to the first question before I say another?\" \"Yes\" She said, you're very good with numbers. \"There was a problem with the date on your calendar?\" \"Yes.\" Susan asks again, now what? She says, oh wait I did say the date doesn't matter no one said \"Well, it DOES mean they said they were on a date today and today.\" Then Susan comes off as a jerk.

            "23 of 24 people found this review helpful I find it repulsive how many times i hear someone say \"Why is it illegal to buy and sell weed on the street in London?\" I say don't do it. 24) What is the hardest job I have ever been through? I go to the fire station and they have a fire extinguisher on me. My job is to help people burn things and I can't. I call in sick and my doctor goes to see me. What do you think? 25) What was the last time someone you knew beat you up to death on a bar? I was in the parking lot of a local Wal-Mart. I pulled over and there was a naked woman. He said he couldn't find a way out of this. He left me alone to my death. I walked into a new daycare and I see a starving man with multiple organ failures all over his body. I get out of the car and start running. What's the worst a Burger King? I see someone was getting thrown into a pit after a car accident. I tell the doctor the bad news: your car is gonna take a lot of hits. I tell the doctor go fast and you may have your organs transplanted back to your brain. And now for the hardest job I have ever done... I have to kill everyone in this life. My father was a great father and he gave every last one of his grandsons a job at a drug store.. I took it from him.. He left me with no choice but to... Work with my sweet... This job pays $20 an hour.. 52) Whats the difference between a rich and poor girl, a week out of hell? I asked a few people out there how they met. The man in the cowboy hat said, the rich girl wants to be a veterinarian. The rich girl says no, because she doesn't like rich men. I said, why don't you have some friends over for a late night\n",
